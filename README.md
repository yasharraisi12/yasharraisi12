I hold an Associate Degree in Architecture (Structural focus) and a Bachelor’s Degree in Interior Architecture. This unique academic background gives me a professional ability to interpret complex architectural blueprints and technical drawings. I have transitioned this expertise into the field of CFD, specializing in wind and pressure simulations using OpenFOAM in Linux environments.

With a strong background in managing interior design projects—from initial client needs to final installation—I bridge the gap between digital simulations and real-world physical structures. I effectively leverage AI tools to optimize my engineering workflows and enhance the accuracy of environmental flow analyses.
